                    As at the time of writing this, before I hit Publish, only 2 bloggers and 2 friends in this whole wide world know what my monthly traffic is. But while building the Food Bloggers Central (“FBC”) website, I decided it was time to open up. Because I want you to have confidence that I’m not just “talk”. That I do have real tips for you, things I figured out, or experimented with that worked (or that did not!) that got me to where I am today.</p>
